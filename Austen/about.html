	<h1>Who is Austen?</h1>
		<pre>
			
			    Born on December 16, 1775, Jane Austen was the seventh of eight children born to George and Cassandra Austen.
			The family lived in Steventon, a small Hampshire town in south-central England, where her father was a minister.
			The Austens were a loving, spirited family that read novels together from the local circulating library and put
			on home theatricals. It was for the family circle that Austen first wrote high-spirited satires â€” some of which
			later became novels after numerous and careful rewritings.

			    Out of her seven siblings, Austen was closest to her only sister, Cassandra. From 1783 to 1785, the two girls
			attended schools in Oxford and Southampton and the Abbey School at Reading. When the Austens could no longer afford the
			tuition, Jane and Cassandra returned home to read extensively and learn from their family how to speak French and Italian
			and play the piano. Most accounts agree that the Austen daughters were pretty and enjoyed the slightly limited but
			interesting round of country parties described in Austen's novels.

			    When Austen was twenty, she met Tom Lefroy, a young Irishman visiting his uncle in Hampshire. Seeing that the two
			young people were on the verge of an engagement, Lefroy's family sent him home rather than letting him attach himself to
			someone as poor as a clergyman's daughter. Austen's second brush with marriage occurred at age twenty-seven, when the wealthy
			Harris Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. The next morning, however, Austen changed her mind, giving up the wealth and
			security inherent in such a match because she did not love him. Although Austen never married, the emphasis of courtship and
			marriage in her novels demonstrates the impact that these experiences had on her and her interest in love and marriage.
					<h3 style="font-size: 24px; margin-left: 60px; margin-bottom: -10px; margin-top: -10px;">What about Lefroy? Hmm...</h3>
				In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted
			to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a "boyish love". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to
			James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,

				<I>	My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that he was in love with her, although he qualified his 
				confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some
				doubt whether I ought to make it public. </I>

			    Austen lived the last eight years of her life in Chawton. Her personal life continued to be limited to family and close
			friends, and she prized herself on being a warm and loving aunt as much as being a successful novelist. A sudden illness,
			possibly Addison's disease, made her stop work on the novel Sandition, and she died in 1817.

		And here is another beautiful moment...
