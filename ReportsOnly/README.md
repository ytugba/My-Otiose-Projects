This folder contains the projects without code.

Software Engineering is not about coding. 

You would be surprised when you would know the number of people you are going to communicate or the number of the pages you are going to write for your work.

They are all needed. I do not say I am good at it, but please put comments in your code files, write guides and proper documentations.

I usually don't, but please do.
