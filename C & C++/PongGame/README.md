When you run the game, you can move the racket to the right using the RIGHT_ARROW_KEY (marked with ->), 
and to the left using the LEFT_ARROW_KEY (marked with <-) on your keyboard. You can enlarge the balls’ size using UP_ARROW_KEY and make them smaller using DOWN_ARROW_KEY. 
In every run, the balls move in random directions, and initialized with random colors. When all the three balls fall to the ground, you can restart the game using ‘r’ key. 
Finally, you can quit the game using ‘q’ key.
